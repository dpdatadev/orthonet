                There are many great online resources for learning about Orthodoxy.
                This page started as my personal home page (PHP) for the latest
                Orthodox content that I had scraped the day before. I found myself always
                going to the same websites and checking the same apps for updated content.
                So I decided to have that data update a page and organize itself so that I
                could have one central place for finding all the updated videos, articles, blogs,
                and resources that I was interested in.

                I then opened up the website to the public in hopes that others could benefit from
                it otherwise.

                I am a Data Engineer by trade which means I work with a lot of backend programming languages
                and do not consider myself a web designer .. so it may not be the prettiest thing to look at - but I sure hope you find it helpful!
